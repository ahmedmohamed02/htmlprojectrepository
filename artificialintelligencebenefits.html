<p>Artificial intelligence can benefit the economy by helping the evolution of work. Robots and AI will help people perform their tasks better, not take their jobs. The combination of man and machine will be unstoppable.

    With deep learning and machine learning, AI can become smarter over time, thus increasing a business' efficiency. AI will also significantly reduce the probability of human error and study historical data to cut costs.
    
    Facial recognition, pattern identification, and digital content analysis will be huge. Academic research, health sciences, and tech companies will enjoy enhanced capabilities.</p>
<p>As crazy as it sounds, AI has already made it in the criminal justice system. Many police departments and courts are turning to artificial intelligence to mitigate bias. A machine now handles profiling and risk assessment. AI looks for patterns in criminal records and historical data to make a recommendation. The analysis should be free from racial, sexual, or other biases - in theory. There have been reports that AI is using data to send people to jail for the wrong reasons. Predicting a person has a "high risk" of future criminal activity without any context is wrong. It's like the movie "Minority Report," where people get arrested before they commit a crime. If the justice system is going to use AI for the long term, it has to be 100% vetted and accurate because lives are at stake. One welcome benefit of AI in the justice system is that the retrieval of information is going to be faster. Algorithms can help people check someoneâ€™s criminal background or any public documents online. Lines at the courthouse or police department will be shorter, putting less strain on police officers and court officials.</p>
